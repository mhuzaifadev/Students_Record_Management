The system is intended to accept process, generate students reports and grades and transcripts accurately. The system is also intended to provide better services to users, provide meaningful, consistent, and timely data and information and finally promotes efficiency by converting paper processes to electronic form. The system was developed using basic technologies such as Java (JDK 15) VM 1.8 with Swing Framework [(Java (GUI + Back-end), (MySQL (Database), Microsoft Azure (Cloud Host)]. The system is free of errors and very efficient and less time consuming due to the care taken to develop it. All the phases of software development cycle are employed, and it is worthwhile to state that the system is user friendly and strong. Provision is made for future development in the system.
